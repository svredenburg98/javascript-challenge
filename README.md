# javascript-challenge

In this challenge I wrote javascript code using d3 to create a filterable table using UFO sightings data. I first wrote code to fill a default table with all of the available data. I then wrote a d3 event listener to read user input in a search box, and then provide a filtered table based on a date. In part two, I created an advanced search option where a user can provide a date, city, state, country and event shape, and filter based on all of those parameters. I combined both challenges into the same webpage, so there is only one folder and collection of files.
